# SimulatedAnnealing

The program uses .tsp files from http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html to run the algorithm

---

## How to run
The program is designed to run in a command prompt. To run it, change to the directory of the files. Make sure you have a .tsp file
in the directory. When executing, it requires one parameter which will be the .tsp file to run the algorithm on.  
For example, use:  
`py Traveling_Salesperson_Problem.py qa194.tsp`

## Output
As the program is running, it will print to the screen the current distances that have been calculated. The algorithm will continue to find shorter distances until it finds an optimal solution and ends. Once finished, the the optimal tour will also be printed to the screen.
